                <h3>Absurd Costs</h3>
                <p>Traditional app development costs $15,000 to $50,000+ for even simple MVPs. Each revision means another invoice, draining your startup budget fast.</p>

                <h3>Endless Delays</h3>

                <h3>Dependency Trap</h3>
                <p>Once developers build your app, you're locked in. Every small change requires going back to them (and paying again), keeping you from iterating quickly.</p>
