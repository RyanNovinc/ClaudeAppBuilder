                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Absolutely not! The course is specifically designed for entrepreneurs and self-starters with zero coding knowledge. If you can use a computer and follow step-by-step instructions, you have all the skills needed to succeed with AppFoundry.</p>

                    <h3>How is this different from no-code platforms like Bubble or Webflow?</h3>

                    <p>Unlike traditional no-code platforms that lock you into their ecosystems with monthly fees, AppFoundry teaches you how to leverage Claude AI to create truly custom apps that you own 100%. You're not limited by platform constraints, there are no ongoing fees, and you can create more complex functionality than most drag-and-drop tools allow.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Most students complete their first functional app within 2-4 weeks of starting the course, working just a few hours per week. You'll start seeing results within the first few hours as you complete the initial modules. The complete curriculum takes about 10-15 hours to work through, and you can apply what you learn immediately to your app project.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>You can build a wide range of business apps including: inventory management systems, client portals, booking platforms, e-commerce apps, productivity tools, service marketplaces, and much more. If your app idea focuses on solving a specific business problem rather than being the next social media giant, AppFoundry is perfect for you.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>You own 100% of any app you create with AppFoundry, with no ongoing fees to us. The code is yours to modify, expand, and commercialize however you want. The only potential ongoing costs would be standard hosting fees (typically $5-20/month depending on your app's needs) and a Claude API subscription if you choose to use their API directly (they offer a free tier that's sufficient for most projects).</p>

                    <p>Claude AI is a powerful language model created by Anthropic. Our course teaches you the exact prompts and techniques to direct Claude to generate code, design interfaces, and build app components. You'll learn structured, step-by-step frameworks that guide the AI to create exactly what you need, even with no technical background.</p>

                    <p>No, you don't need to purchase any additional software.
