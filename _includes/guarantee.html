                <p>If you can't create a working app within 60 days of taking this course, I'll give you 100% of your money back, no questions asked.</p>
                <p>All I ask is that you show me you've made a sincere effort by sharing your project files. This is my way of ensuring your success while taking all the risk off your shoulders.</p>
                <p><strong>I'm so confident in this system because I've seen complete beginners transform into app creators in days, not months.</strong></p>
