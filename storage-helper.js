When I found the AppFoundry course, I was skeptical that I could really build something without coding knowledge, but I decided to give it a try.\n\nThe step-by-step guidance was incredible. I followed each module, and within 3 weeks, I had a working app that tracks sleep patterns, sends reminders, and even generates reports. My friends were shocked when I told them I built it myself without writing code!\n\nThe most valuable part was learning how to communicate effectively with Claude AI to get exactly what I wanted. Now I can make changes and improvements whenever I need to, without being dependent on expensive developers.\n\nThanks to AppFoundry, I\'ve gone from having zero technical skills to being able to bring my ideas to life independently!',

When I discovered AppFoundry, it seemed too good to be true - build my own custom app without coding?\n\nBut it actually worked! Following the course, I was able to create a recipe app that lets me organize recipes by cuisine, dietary restrictions, and cooking time. It even has a meal planning feature that I designed myself!\n\nThe best part is that I can continue to improve it whenever I want. Last week I added a feature to automatically generate shopping lists from selected recipes, and it took me just a few hours!',
